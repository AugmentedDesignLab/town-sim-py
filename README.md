# town-sim-py
Town growth simulator that creates road networks.

Outputs a text file, output.txt, in the same directory program is run. output.txt contains lists of roads, and if the road is curved, a list of its turning points. 

We mirror-forked SUMO here: https://github.com/julinas/sumo-mirror making some minor changes to SUMO's netgenerate program. Edited files are netgen/NGEdge.* , netgen/NGNet.* , and netgen/NGFrame.* 

The added usage is: --town-sim --town-sim.file=[filename1] --output-file=[filename2] where filename1 should be the location of the file generated by town-sim-py and filename2 is the output location of the resulting .net.xml file.
