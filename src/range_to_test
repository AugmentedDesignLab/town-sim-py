*is default in code
@use as default in test
%does not have much effect

1. lower mi:ma results in more windy mi roads
2. hi ma seems to result in dendritic roads
check broken roads?

parameter variation screenshots

8-10 image sequence showing growth 
river crossing
radial bypass screenshots sequence ... point to it 
garden conversion (even though it doesn't do anything)

1. write save state code
2. confirm that bypasses work 
3. test all params 

Analysis
* radial road angle analysis
* depth && connectivity 
* other road angle (on grid)
* screenshots chart
